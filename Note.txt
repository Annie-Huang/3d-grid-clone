You will need to adjust the screen width to see effect.
but basically,
for super large screen size: you can see everything
as screen size becomes smaller, you lost some buttons on the right side of .feature-grid
as the screen size grow even more smaller, the left side button of .feature-grid will shift underneath the .feature-grid-text
